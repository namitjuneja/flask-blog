And here it goes, my first blog post on a platform I built on my own. Feels pretty nice.

Well this thing needs a lot of improvement right not, but the basic framework works and it feels pretty nice.

Mostly inspired by "The Social Network", Mark Zuckerberg. His side by side live blogging was pretty fascinating and that was the prime thing that motivated me to complete this long pending project and the beta is out :D

Another motivation for me to this was me feeling a bit to sad and lonely these days and I guess rather than finding new friends I just decided to make a platform where I could express myself, LOL. After all I guess Its the engineering instinct inside me.

Well about the blog. I am going to try to keep it concentrated and write some meaningful stuff about me, my work, my feelings etc. Not going to be very refined writing, just expressing myself.

Well that's it for the first blog

Good day.
And yes today is Diwali too :)
